"Malaysian men put value into looking good, with the male grooming market growing","Wednesday, 07 Feb 2024","['With more men interested in grooming and skincare new beauty brands are ready for a different customer base in an industry that was previously saturated with products for women', 'Take Nateskin for example a Malaysian company which sells personal body care and grooming products The brand says it is witnessing a change in attitude among men in the country', 'The mens grooming market is growing because more people are concerned about personal hygiene says cofounder Jared Chuah', 'The market growth is not only observed in the United States United Kingdom or Australia we are also seeing the same trend in Malaysia as well as neighbouring countries', 'Nateskin carries a range of electric shavers and trimmers for face and body', 'It is not taboo for men to talk about grooming their body hair anymore Chuah points out', 'Five years ago if you approach a guy on the street and ask him about his thoughts on grooming he would probably just talk about hairstyle or eliminating body odour Today men walk into our stores and ask how to manscape or trim body hair to improve their appearance It shows how times have changed', 'Beauty company Deciems chief scientific officer Prudvi Mohan Kaka agrees that there is an increased male interest in skincare now', 'When we look at different market research sources the predicted compound annual growth rate CAGR of the global male skincare market varies some predict a double digit growth while others tell us were looking at a rate similar to that of the skincare market as a whole he adds', 'The fact that male skincare is at least keeping up with the rest of the market tells us that weve come a long way in the cosmetics industry', 'One of the brands under Deciem is The Ordinary Launched in Canada in 2016 the brand has expanded globally including into Malaysia', 'While The Ordinary does not genderspecify its products it still pays attention to the buying habits of men', 'A 2021 study on the skincare habits of Malaysian men showed that few consumers purchase products to slow ageing but in a study in the same year conducted in the US skin ageing was shown to be one of the main concerns of men Kaka says', 'I cannot tell you exactly why this stark difference exists but the various skin needs of the skincare consumers were what inspired our products in the first place', 'He adds that The Ordinary does not create products for a specific consumer  rather it seeks to address different skin needs and concerns', 'Ultimately this shows that men are not very different from women', 'Mens skincare is serious business so brands have to target individual needs within that market and they can no longer get away with just a generic madeformen range', 'According to data gathered by market insight company Statista in September last year the global male grooming market is predicted to be worth US115bil approximately RM544bil by 2028 This is up from nearly US80bil RM378bil in 2022', 'The report states that there has been a pivotal shift in male pampering culture during the last decade', 'While mens toilettries back then used to consist of shampoo deodorant shaving cream and not much else male shoppers now fill their baskets with products like moisturiser facial cleanser eye serum and even mud mask', 'There are some skincare concerns that men can better relate to', 'Kaka says one of the biggest differences between genders is the presence of facial hair or beard and specifically the choice that many men make to shave them', 'Shaving is essentially a form of exfoliation and a very harsh one at that too It can lead to compromised skin barrier irritation and redness he explains', 'When we create a soothing product our team is always excited to see the results on the skin of our customers who shave particularly to help with postshaving irritation', 'In Malaysia specifically oily skin and body odour are the top two concerns among men Kaka says that this is something expected in countries with tropical climate and high humidity', 'These can be targeted by appropriate cleansing while oiliness can be resolved by products containing ingredients that help to either balance sebum production or absorb excess sebum to reduce shine', 'He adds that men should not ignore the risks of UV exposure Above all protection is key so sunscreen should be applied daily by everyone', 'Beyond that ingredients like niacinamide vitamin C azelaic acid and alpha arbutin can help tackle uneven tone while peptides and retinoids are to target signs of ageing Kaka advises', 'Chuah who studied and used to worked in Australia says that he was initially unsure how Malaysian men would react to shaving products for the body', 'Things like personal grooming are really openly talked about discussed and advertised in Australia he points out', 'The strategy Nateskin uses in communicating with consumers here is to focus on conversational topics Humour works too', 'Chuah says Nateskin does not use models for its campaigns', 'We use our customers in social media postings We want to show that you dont have to look like Chris Hemsworth to care about grooming Taking care of your looks should be something every man can relate to', 'Nateskin also aims to send out a message on how men should not feel awkward about grooming themselves  in other words to normalise the habit', 'Why do you need to have a healthy grooming habit Or why shave Firstly its a matter of hygiene Chua says', 'Secondly its about comfort When you live in a high humidity climate having too much body hair can trap sweat and make us feel hotter than we already are on any given day', 'He does however say that this still boils down to personal preference There is a fine line between advocating healthy grooming habits and creating a false ideal of what a man should look like', 'Men should be aware that grooming isnt about about changing themselves to fit in or be trendy', 'We are not saying guys must shave but if they want to then its alright  and there are products that will help Chuah says', 'In terms of facial hair even if you want to grow it out grooming involves maintaining a neat trimmed beard it is not about having or not having hair it is more on removing unwanted hair']"
